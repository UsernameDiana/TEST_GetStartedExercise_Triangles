# TEST_GetStartedExercise_Triangles
I. Design of test cases

_Make a set of test cases(i.e. specific sets of data) taht will adequately test this program:_

_The program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program displays a message that states whether the triagle is scalene (no equal sides), isosceles (two sides are equal), or equilateral (all sides are equal)._

* Step 1: Design test cases (on paper) for both successful and unsuccessful scenarios.

* Step 2: Design and implement the Triangle program in a programming language (e.g. Java or C#)
  - you don't have to write unit tests, but you may do so :)
  - No need for a nice GUI, just console app is fine
  
  * Bring the code next time
  * Have an IDE installed on your computer
